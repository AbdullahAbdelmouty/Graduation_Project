# Project objective:
The objective of our graduation project is to design and implement a comprehensive system that enhances cybersecurity by detecting evasive malware in PDF files using advanced deep learning techniques. This system integrates three key components: artificial intelligence, web development, and embedded systems, each playing a crucial role in achieving our goal.
### Artificial Intelligence:
Our first aim is to develop a robust deep-learning model capable of accurately identifying malware in PDF files. This model will be trained on a diverse dataset of known malware and benign files, ensuring it can effectively distinguish between safe and malicious content. The use of deep learning allows the system to learn complex patterns and improve detection accuracy over time, making it a reliable solution for identifying evasive malware.
### Web Development:
The second component involves creating a user-friendly website that allows users to upload PDF files for malware scanning. This website will serve as the interface for the AI model, providing real-time analysis and feedback to users. When a user uploads a PDF, the website will process the file using the trained deep learning model and promptly inform the user whether the PDF contains malware. This seamless interaction ensures that users can easily and quickly verify the safety of their documents without needing specialized knowledge.
# My Contribute in the Project:
As Backend Developer I was responsabile for desgine the system, and database schema to provide rebust system to provide the end user to use the ML Model to check if the pdf is benign or malicious.
I started with specify the function and non-functional requirements for the systme,then designed the schema of the database for relational database.
